# WCUP Survey

The program was developed to create a quick survey regarding the last fifa world cup and the questioner would ask 3 simple questions along with few personal data, which team do you think can win (2 options), which team could be a great surprise and which one has no chance to win.

## How it works

- The questions will be a series of inputs to fill out the questions.
- The program will consume an API from google docs and fill out a spreadsheet with all information as per answered to the questioner.

- A JSON file was created with all info and added to the .gitignore

### Features Left to Implement
- The program should bring some numbers of: 
- Participants
- Most and less voted for winner, surprise and no chance
- The mosted voted among female and male

### Bugs To Fix
- All inputs should be tested per type and input based on the info entry such as name = string, age = number, as well as the input for gender should only accept one character f/m
- The questionarie should only accept teams inputs based on a list of teams that are participating on the competition.

### Content 
- The content in this project was developed based on the 3 Portfolio scope project by Code Institute
